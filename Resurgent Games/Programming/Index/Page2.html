<p id="main_p">I was born and raised in Littlerock, CA. My parents were from the various parts of Southern California, but settled down in Littlerock around 1989. I have three brother and a sister, all of whom are musically talented. Our parents were determined not to let us squander the benefit of growing up with a piano teacher who lived and taught in her home directly across the street from us. So we all learned.</p>
<p id="main_p">One other unique trait that my siblings and I all have in common is that, at one point in our lives, each one of us was homeschooled. Mind you, we weren't homeschoolers (the kids who wore overalls)<br><a href="Page3.html">Click Here For Boxes!</a>
