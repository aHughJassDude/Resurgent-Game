<h3>What Makes Us Different?</h3>


<p>Our products <strong>do not contain sugar</strong> or artificial colors and sweeteners. If it's not all natural, it's not in the bottle. <em>Less</em> sodas have almost as many calories as good old H<sub>2</sub>O, and they have only half the carbonation of regular soft drinks<sup>1</sup> like Coke&reg; or other national brands.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>When compared to the leading cola-flavored beverages.</p>

<p>Our Orange Nut Cream is a blend of natural orange flavors and real coconut milk. The resulting combination gives our Orange Nut Cream an incredibly smooth and rich taste.</p>

<blockquote>Think a soft drink can't be good for you? Think again! <em>Less</em> sodas are enhanced with vitamins and minerals to fortify you through your busy day. Not only do our sodas and beverages taste great, they also are a good source of nutrition.</blockquote>
