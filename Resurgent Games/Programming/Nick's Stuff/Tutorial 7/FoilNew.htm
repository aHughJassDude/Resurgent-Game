	<td><p>The Sound Bay Ferry wishes to announce the arrival of a new addition to the Sound Bay Ferry Service. Starting this Memorial Day, the Cove Cruiser hydrofoil will be added to our fleet of vessels.</p>

<p>What is a hydrofoil? A hydrofoil is a boat with wing-like foils mounted on struts below the hull. As the boat moves faster through the water, the boat develops enough speed so that the hydrofoils gently lift the hull above the water.</p>

<p>The hydrofoil provides for a much smoother and more stable ride than a traditional boat, especially at higher speeds. The Cove Cruiser generally will be able to ply the waters of Sound Bay at twice the speed of vessels now in service.</p>

<p>The Cove Cruiser comes with many state-of-the-art facilities, such as wireless connectivity for laptops; wide-screen plasma televisions mounted in several areas below deck; and comfortable, wide, padded seating. The Cove Cruiser has a large dining facility where you can enjoy a delicious breakfast or lunch served to you either below deck or above deck.</p></td>
