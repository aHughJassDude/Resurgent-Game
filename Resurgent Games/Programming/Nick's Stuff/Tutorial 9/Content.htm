<h1>Simple Talk, Complex Coffee</h1>

<p>At Stormm's, we speak your talk. You can order using terms like "large coffee," "coffee with milk," or "tea." We give you what you really want, which is complex coffee with great taste, not fancy coffee jargon that you can't pronounce. We provide you with a comfortable, relaxing, clean environment so that you can enjoy your stay with us. We have much more than just coffee and tea. Every season has a great reason for coming to Stormm's. In the winter and fall, try our great hot chocolate and hot apple cider. In the spring and summer, try our iced drinks, ice cream, and fountain drinks. Hungry for breakfast or lunch? Sample one of our bagels, croissants, rolls, muffins, and wraps. Had dinner? Come in and enjoy our line of freshly baked pies, cakes, and other scrumptious desserts.</p>

<h2>Travel the Globe</h2>

<p>Come into Stormm's and try our coffees from all over the world. You've probably had coffee from Brazil and Columbia &mdash; that's our popular South American blend, but have you ever had coffee from Sumatra or Kenya? Try a cup and see if you enjoy the rich, deep flavor. You'll also enjoy our French Roast and our espresso coffees, too.</p>

<p>Forget the weather forecast. Get caught in a Stormm's today.</p>
