<p><em>Link</em> was just a farm boy in a village called Ordon. One day <em>Zant</em>, the evil and corrupt king of the Twilight Realm, and his minions appeared and attacked the village. They then brought Link into the Twilight Realm where he transformed into a wolf because the realm is magical. He then meets <em>Midna</em> who helps him turn back into himself and helps him on his quest to defeat Zant and save Hyrule.</p>

<p>In his quest, Link travels far off to snowy mountains, a scorching desert, the bottom of a lake, and inside a volcano. He obtains many items to help him on his quest including:
